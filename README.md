## I am currently implementing features and fixing architecture as much as I can to prepare to implement Vulkan API.
I am building a DirectX11 graphics engine to learn the basics of graphics programming. The project is setup in a way, that you can clone it, open the solution with VS2022 and run it.

I am making a YouTube series along the way https://youtube.com/@Code_Gains

## Contributing
I don't really have guidelines for contributions yet, however you are free to fork the repository, make some improvements and open a pull request. Just have in mind that I will be able to freely edit, merge or close the pull requests you make. I might have to come up with a different solution if interest in the project increases.
