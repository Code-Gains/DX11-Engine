# DX11-Engine

I am building a DirectX11 graphics engine to learn the basics of graphics programming. The project is setup in a way, that you can clone it, open the solution with VS2022 and run it.

I am making a YouTube series along the way https://youtube.com/@Code_Gains
## Current project
Current learning project is to create some sort of multithreaded variation of **Entity Component System** (ECS). I really want to utilize all the cores modern processors provide. The planned demo for this is a simulation of objects orbiting a planet that I will primarily use for benchmarks.
  
I have plans to add **Vulkan** and **DirectX12** support in the future, but for now I am just doing whatever I feel like is challenging and fun for myself.
  
## Contributing
I don't really have guidelines for contributions yet, however you are free to fork the repository, make some improvements and open a pull request. Just have in mind that I will be able to freely edit, merge or close the pull requests you make. I might have to come up with a different solution if interest in the project increases.
