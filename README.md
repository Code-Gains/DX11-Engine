## I am currently rewritting the Entity-Component-System into an Archetype based one. This will allow to multithread the Engine Core, my hope is to merge the code by the end of March https://github.com/Code-Gains/DX11-Engine/tree/ECSComponentStorage
# DX11-Engine

I am building a DirectX11 graphics engine to learn the basics of graphics programming. The project is setup in a way, that you can clone it, open the solution with VS2022 and run it.

I am making a YouTube series along the way https://youtube.com/@Code_Gains
## Current project
Currently creating a list of features to implement. Along with features I will be changing the structure of the project to make it more maintanable.
  
I have plans to add **Vulkan** and **DirectX12** support in the future, but for now I am just doing whatever I feel like is challenging and fun for myself.
  
## Contributing
I don't really have guidelines for contributions yet, however you are free to fork the repository, make some improvements and open a pull request. Just have in mind that I will be able to freely edit, merge or close the pull requests you make. I might have to come up with a different solution if interest in the project increases.
